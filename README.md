What is programming?

Short answer: telling the computer what to do by writing what-may-appear-to-be magical symbols.

Answer: check out this set of projects.

Here you'll find lots of introductory projects for many of different applications written in a variety of notable programming languages.

Try to get all of them running! Or just your favorite, or even a random one.

## Formal Steps:

0. Pick a random project. A number from 0 to TODO
1. Guess what the project does
2. Get the project running
3. Dig deep.

## **Many of these technologies are in use in the "real world"**

Scientists need these tools.
Companies are hiring. 
People are using programming to create fascinating new things daily, and you can jump in to this innovative world!
Many universities prepare their graduates for graduate school or the industry by teaching them these technologies, along with a healthy and necessary dose of fundamental computer science.
This brief introduction to these concepts and your motivation to figure out what's going on could help you out in many ways.

If you enjoy your field of programming, you'll enjoy learning more about it.

## Projects Created in Most Programming Languages

Each of these projects is written in each of the numerous programming languages you'll discover as you read through this document.

**Challenges**: Try them out! Compare and contrast two languages that stand out to you.

### Common Project 0: Hello, World!

Writes the message "Hello, world!"

Getting this minimal program working lets you know you're on the right track to mastery of the given programming language.

**Challenges**: Make sure your code editor is awesome and functional; have a good file backup strategy, consider using Dropbox; install and use Linux; make small changes in the code and get your code to run!

### Common Project 1: A Minimal Video-Game: 2048 * 2048 * 1024

FUN!

**Challenges**: make a more complicated game; add multiplayer; create and add your own writing, images, and sound effects; publish to a store (Steam, Google Play); add ads. 

### Common Project 2: A Simple Website

A simple website.

TODO Hello world screenshot

**Challenges**: use CSS to create a good-looking website, add fancy animations, use https://web.dev to scrutinize your web development skills, connect to a web server, add data analytics (like Google Analytics), create an advanced data visualizations, create a personal website, make your website go viral.

### Common Project 3: The hello-world Web Server

GET /hello
POST /hello-to-recipients {"recipients":["mars","venus"]}

How a hello-world web server should work:

- you start up your server in some way
- you make requests to it. easiest way is to visit it using your web browser. figure out it's web address :)
- you can visit it to see the message `"hello, world"`
- you can visit another address to see `"hello, {custom recipient}!"`

TODO tense
TODO sample session
TODO: screenshot
TODO: change POST route to form

**Challenges**: Add the ability to save data (i.e. use a database); clone your favorite webapp like YouTube, TikTok, Craigslist, Minecraft game server; make an app (doesn't have to be unique); pitch to an investor, go to a hackathon.

### Common Project 4: MNIST Neural Network

This is data science aka machine learning aka artificial intelligence aka applied mathematics.
Get hype!

Train a handwritten numerical digit recognizer. (TODO MNIST)

Run the digit recognizer (on your own input?)
(include a converter)

it's just math. works on everything!

**Challenges**: train a slightly less simple model, find run a pre-trained complex model, find natural language and computer vision models, think of ethical uses for machine learning, make something unexpected, learn all the math you need to more clearly understand what's going on.

## Programming Languages

### Python

Python is a popular and powerful programming language.
It is used for introductory programming courses, as well as in many scientific and professional areas.

| hello world   | game          | web site      | web server    | MNIST AI      |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ✔             | ✔             | ✗ (see JavaScript or other languages) | ✔             | ✔             |

#### Project 5: Automation of Computer Tasks

Try these out!

Instagram automation using `instabot`, write to a Google Docs Sheets from Python, automate browser tasks using Selenium.

**Challenges**: have fun, don't be evil, automate the boring stuff away!!!

#### Project 6: Data Science

Check out the DataPy and SciPy universe!
Useful for statistics, data analysis, and visualizations.

**Challenges**: find and analyze a dataset you find interesting, create and share a new dataset, share your findings and techniques with a relevant community.

### JavaScript

JavaScript is used to make websites, web servers, and many other things.

JavaScript is completely unrelated to Java. JavaScript is relatively inconsistent compared to every other programming language; however, it is well-supported and has a vibrant community.
Like Python, it is both used as an introductory language and as a language in the industry.

| hello world   | game          | web site      | web server    | MNIST AI      |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ✔             | ✔             | ✔             | ✔             | ✔ (only running; see Python for training) |

### Common Project 7: miniPython Interpreter

This is a minimal Python interpreter.
It can run simple Python programs.

A programming language is itself a program.
You can create your own programming language.
CONSIDER YOURSELF LEVELED-UP IN COMPUTER SCIENCE.

Any interpreter would work like this:

1. Run an interpreter for your favorite language on a file of computer code
2. Observe and interact with results, errors, and warnings

**Challenges**: invent your own programming language, create a community, welcome new programmers, learn what a compiler is, learn about compiler optimization.

### Common Project 8: miniJavaScript Interpreter

Just like miniPython.

### C

*C* is another popular language for introductory programming.
Almost every modern-day computer has a C compiler, which means C is essential to lower-level programming.
It is fascinating in its own right to learn about low-level computing concepts. 

| hello world   | game          | web site      | web server    | MNIST AI      |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| ✔             | 

| miniJavaScript | miniPython |
| ---            | ---        |
| ✔              | ✔          |

#### Project 8: Linux Kernel Module

**Challenges**: develop an interesting kernel module, learn what Linux is, only code in Ring-0

### OCaml

In use in the financial industry. May be considered specialized, esoteric, futuristic, or relatively advanced.

| hello world   | game          | web site      | web server    | MNIST AI      |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ✔             | ✔             | ✔             | ✔             | ✔             |

| miniJavaScript | miniPython |
| ---            | ---        |
| ✔              | ✔          |

### Rust

In use for low-level programming. May replace C someday. Also may be considered specialized, esoteric, futuristic, or relatively advanced.

| hello world   | game          | web site      | web server    | MNIST AI      |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ✔             | ✔             | (let's not)   | ✔

| miniJavaScript | miniPython |
| ---            | ---        |
| ✔              | ✔          |

### Haskell

Does everything. May be considered magic.


| hello world   | game          | web site      | web server    | MNIST AI      |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ✔             | ✔             | ✔             | ✔             | ✔             |

| miniJavaScript | miniPython |
| ---            | ---        |
| ✔              | ✔          |

### Lisp

Does everything.
An early programming language. Has inspired all languages built after 1959.
Minimalism at its finest.

| hello world   | game          | web site      | web server    | MNIST AI      |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ✔             | ✔             | ✔             | ✔             | ✔             |

| miniJavaScript | miniPython |
| ---            | ---        |
| ✔              | ✔          |

### Prolog

Another early programming language. Helps you interact with the essence of logic.

| hello world   | some fucking elegant magical thing |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ✔             | ✔             |
